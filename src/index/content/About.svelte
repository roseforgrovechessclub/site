    Rose Forgrove Chess Club, the largest chess club in Leeds, was established
    in the 1970s. During the league season, we play in various competitions

    > (Saturdays). Matches in the Leeds league are played with a time control of
    G80+10, which is 80 minutes per game with a ten-second increment added after
    each move from move one.

    In the off-season, we run the club championship and a variety of club nights
    and competitions.

    There is no membership fee. There is a board fee for any game played at our
    home venue and for away games played on a Saturday. The fee is currently

    juniors under 18 (£2.20), or instead pay a yearly board fee of £99.00. The
    club has moved to a cashless payment method and a card reader is used for
    the collection of board fees, payment by cash is not accepted.
