    <p>
      General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Privacy Notice for your

    </p>

    <H3>What personal data does Rose Forgrove Chess Club collect?</H3>
    <p>
      The data we routinely collect includes members’ names, addresses, email
      addresses and phone numbers. We collect this data directly from our
      members when they join the club and on a yearly basis before the start of
      the new chess season.
    </p>
    <p>
      We collect the scores from the games you play, which are then displayed on
      the Chessnuts website, the Leeds Chess Association (LCA) website, the
      English Chess Federation (ECF) website, on our website and some are
      circulated to members’ through email.
    </p>

    <H3>What is this personal data used for?</H3>
    <p>
      We use members’ data for the administration of your membership, the
      communication of information and the organisation of events.
    </p>

    <H3>Who is your data shared with?</H3>
    <p>
      Members’ renewing their ECF membership through Rose Forgrove Chess Club
      will have the relevant data passed on to the ECF.
    </p>

    <p>
      The scores from the matches you play for the club are passed on to the
      LCA, the Yorkshire Chess Association (YCA) and ECF for calculating your
      grade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your personal data is not passed on by us to organisations other than
      those indicated above, whether or not connected with chess.
    </p>

    <H3>Where does this data come from?</H3>
    <p>
      Data for our members comes from them when they join Rose Forgrove Chess
      Club, when they inform the Club of any changes and on a yearly basis
      before the start of the chess season. Scoring data comes directly from the
      results of the games you play.
    </p>

    <H3>How is your data stored?</H3>
    <p>
      This information is stored in digital form on the Club Vice-Captain’s
      computer and in the form of written documents stored at the Club
      Vice-Captain’s home.
    </p>

    <H3>
      Who is responsible for ensuring compliance with the relevant laws and
      regulations?
    </H3>
    <p>
      Under the GDPR we do not have a statutory requirement to have a Data
      Protection Officer. The Rose Forgrove Chess Club Committee is responsible
      for ensuring that the Rose Forgrove Chess Club discharges its obligations
      under the GDPR.
    </p>

    <H3>Who has access to your data?</H3>
    <p>
      Members of the committee of Rose Forgrove Chess Club have access to
      members’ data in order for them to carry out their legitimate tasks for
      the club.
    </p>

    <H3>What is the legal basis for collecting this data?</H3>
    <p>
      Rose Forgrove Chess Club collects personal data that is necessary for the
      purposes of its legitimate interests as a membership organisation and
      participant in an internationally recognised and regulated mind sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some data, such as that relating to financial matters, the basis for
      its collection and retention is to comply with our legal obligations.
    </p>

    <H3>How you can check what data we have about you?</H3>
    <p>
      If you want to know the basic membership data we hold about you, you
      should contact Clive Davies.
    </p>

    <H3>Does Rose Forgrove Chess Club collect any “special” data?</H3>
    <p>
      The GDPR refers to sensitive personal data as “special categories of
      personal data”. We do not record any such special data.
    </p>

    <H3>How can you ask for data to be removed, limited, or corrected?</H3>
    <p>There are ways in which you can limit how your data is used.</p>
    <p>
      You could maintain your club membership with your correct name but with
      limited contact details. However, we do need to have at least one method
      of contacting you. You could for example simply maintain an up-to-date
      email address. This option can be implemented by contacting Clive Davies.
    </p>
    <p>
      You do not need to provide us with your date of birth unless you wish to
      gain concessions based on age.
    </p>

    <H3>How long do we keep your data for and why?</H3>
    <p>
      We normally keep members’ data after they resign or their membership
      lapses in case they later wish to re-join. However, we will delete any
      former member’s contact details entirely on request.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since underlying statistical data, like scores from chess games continues
      to be necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was originally
      collected and processed, results from events used for the calculation of
      grades, are not deleted by Rose Forgrove Chess Club, the LCA, the YCA, or
      the ECF.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historical ranking lists and prize lists are required for archiving
      purposes and names cannot be removed from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other data, such as that relating to accounting or personnel matters, is
      kept for the legally required period.
    </p>

    <H3>What happens if a member dies?</H3>
    <p>
      We normally keep members’ information after they die. If requested by
      their next-of-kin to delete the information we will do so on the same
      basis as when requested to remove data by a former member.
